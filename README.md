# Final Project: Chipping-In Chicago

Welcome to Chipping-In Chicago! This application gives you real time information on stockpiles of current items donated to a homeless shelter in Chicago. It also allows you to donate items as well.

## Project Motivation

With this project, we wanted to help try and alleviate the current migrant crisis here in Chicago. Especially with the winter weather, it is more crucial than ever to support the homeless populations here in the city.

### User Story
